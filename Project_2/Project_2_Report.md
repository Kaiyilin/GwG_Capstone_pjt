### Process phase
- Before you start, things you must know and done
  <ol>
    <li> Tools: SQL, Speadsheet and Python </li>
    <li> Document the cleaning process <br>
  </ol>
- The goal in this phase
  <ol>
    <li> Check the data for errors. </li>
    <li> Transform the data so you can work with it effectively. </li>
  </ol>

- First we check all the data using python


### Analyse phase

- The goal of this pahse
  <ol>
    <li> Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible </li>
    <li> Organize and format your data </li>
    <li> Perform calculations </li>
    <li> Identify trends and relationships </li>
  </ol>

### Share phase
- What I discovered
  <ol>
    <li> Generally, we 33 unique user in this dataset. Overall 33 users track their daily activity, 24 users track their sleep, 14 users track their heart rate and 8 users track their weights. </li>

    <li> The daily activity tracker is the most popular and the weight track is the least popular service for the user</li>  
  </ol>

- My opinion
  <ol>  
    <li> Most of the users may not know how to use their devices, generally there are great potential for the rest of the services</li>
    <li> Users with smart devices might seek an healthier life. It's clearly that users who have greater daily activity consumed more calories, therefore company could use this to encourage users use more service company provided including recording their weight changes. And eventually subcibe our membership to get advice based on the data they record</li>
  </ol>
